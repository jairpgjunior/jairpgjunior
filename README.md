# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm JJ

Iâ€™m a product-driven technologist with 10+ years of experience in software engineering and technical leadership. I specialize in creating scalable, high-impact digital products with a strong focus on usability, performance, and delivery speed.

After founding and exiting [**gStudio**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gstudioapp/), a low-code platform that replaced fragile Excel workflows with structured, UX-focused tools, Iâ€™ve been focused on how AI can accelerate product development and unlock new digital experiences.

Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my expertise in **AI and Machine Learning** through hands-on work and certifications, with a particular interest in large language models, orchestration frameworks, and intelligent automation.
